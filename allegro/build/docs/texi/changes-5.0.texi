@anchor{#changes-from-4.9.20-to-4.9.21-july-2010}
The main developers this time were: Trent Gamblin, Matthew Leverton,
Elias Pschernig, Paul Suntsov, Peter Wang.

Graphics:

@itemize
@item
Fixed the mis-termed ``blend color''. There is no more color state.

@itemize
@item
al_set*_blender functions lose the color parameter.

@item
Added 5 new bitmap drawing functions al_draw_tinted*_bitmap with a color
parameter. The parameter is used just like the ``blend color'' before.

@item
All text drawing functions gain a color parameter and use it like they
used the ``blend color'' before.

@item
Primitive drawing functions previously sometimes (and sometimes not)
used the ``blend color''. Not any longer.

@end itemize

@item
Make the current blending mode thread-local state instead of per-display
state.

@item
Add explicit display arguments to functions which require a display, but
don't require the rendering context to be current.

@item
Make al_set_target_bitmap change the current display as necessary.
al_set_target_bitmap(NULL) releases the rendering context.

@item
Add al_set_target_backbuffer as a convenience.

@item
Remove al_set_current_display.

@item
Give each bitmap its own transformation, i.e.@ every bitmap has a
transformation, which is in effect when that bitmap is the target.

@item
Remove sub-bitmap clip-to-parent restriction on create. Add
out-of-bounds blitting support to memory bitmaps.

@item
Merge sub-bitmap and parent bitmap clipping; clip source bitmap to
(0,0)-(w,h); fix flipping to/from clipped bitmaps.

@item
Made mouse cursors independent of displays. You may create cursors
without a display, and you may use a cursor with any display.

@item
Rename al_@{set,get@}_current_video_adapter to *new_display_adapter for
consistency.

@item
Move the new display video adapter and new window position to
thread-local state, like other new display parameters. Make
al_store_state also save those parameters with
ALLEGRO_STATE_NEW_DISPLAY_PARAMETERS.

@item
Rename al_transform_transform to al_compose_transform. Switched the
order of parameters in al_compose_transform and al_copy_transform to
match the rest of the transform functions.

@item
Made memory bitmap manipulation without a display possible (again?).

@item
Fixed window resizing in D3D driver. Simplify resize-postponing on
Windows.

@item
Make al_create_display abort early when the new_display_adapter is
greater than the screen count (X11).

@item
Added ALLEGRO_MINIMIZED flag to the X11 port.

@item
Fixed OpenGL version string parsing (bug #3016654).

@end itemize

Other core:

@itemize
@item
Renamed al_install_timer to al_create_timer, and al_uninstall_timer to
al_destroy_timer.

Rename al_@{get,set@}_@{appname,orgname@} to *app_name and *org_name.

@item
Fix assertion failure in al_create_mutex_recursive on Windows (spoofle).

@end itemize

Primitives addon:

@itemize
@item
Made the D3D driver of the primitives addon work with multiple displays.
Also made it handle the display being destroyed properly.

@item
Simplified shader recreating on thread destruction when using the
primitives addon with D3D.

@item
Avoid double free when shutting down the primitives addon multiple
times.

@item
Older Intel cards don't implement DrawIndexedPrimitiveUP correctly.
Altered the D3D code to work around that.

@item
Make GDI+ image loader work with MinGW.
@end itemize

Font addon:

@itemize
@item
Nicolas Martyanoff added al_get_font_descent/ascent functions which
query per-font properties. Previously it was necessary to call
al_get_text_dimensions (which now just reports the text dimensions as it
should).
@end itemize

Native dialogs addon:

@itemize
@item
Add text log window functions (GTK only for now).
@end itemize

Documentation:

@itemize
@item

@anchor{#changes-from-4.9.19-to-4.9.20-may-2010}
The developers this time were: Thomas Fjellstrom, Evert Glebbeek,
Matthew Leverton, Milan Mimica, Paul Suntsov, Trent Gamblin, Elias
Pschernig, Peter Wang. With significant contributions from Michał
Cichoń.

Core:

throughout Allegro and its addons.

@item
Replace al_set_memory_management_functions by a simpler function,
al_set_memory_interface.

@item
Renamed some D3D/Windows specific functions to follow the
al_@{verb@}_@{stuff@} convention.

@end itemize

Graphics:

@itemize
@item
Move image I/O framework to core, i.e.@ al_load_bitmap, al_save_bitmap
and bitmap file type registration. Image codecs remain in allegro_image.

@item
Added a simple display capabilities querying capability to
al_get_display_option: ALLEGRO_MAX_BITMAP_SIZE,
ALLEGRO_SUPPORT_NPOT_BITMAP, ALLEGRO_CAN_DRAW_INTO_BITMAP,
ALLEGRO_SUPPORT_SEPARATE_ALPHA. (OpenGL only for now)

@item
Fix in OpenGL 3.0 context creation.

@item
Make the extensions mechanism compatible with OpenGL version >= 3.
Declared symbols needed by OpenGL 3.2 and 3.3 and brought OpenGL
extensions up to date.

@item
Fix an assertion in _al_draw_bitmap_region_memory so it does not trigger
when source and destination are the same bitmap.

@item
Fix some locking issues by setting GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT and
GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT before reading/writing pixels.

@item
Partial implementation of ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW on OS X (Snow
Leopard, probably Leopard).

@item
Started X11 fullscreen support (resolution switching).

@item
Fix handling of X11 size hints.

@item
Fixed a deadlock related to fullscreen windows under X11 caused by using
a nested lock for a condition variable.

@item
Use _NET_WM_ICON to set icon on X11 instead of XSetWMHints.

@item
Get the iPhone OpenGL version more properly. Only use separate blending
on iPhone with OpenGL ES 2.0+.

@item
Release the splash view and windows on iPhone, which makes backgrounding
Allegro apps on OS 4.0 work.

@item
Updated iphone port for IPad (only tested in the simulator).

@end itemize

Input:

@itemize
@item
Disabled Raw Input code in Windows. Mouse events now reflect system
cursor movements even in fullscreen mode.

@item
Prevent late WM_MOUSELEAVE notifications from overriding mouse state
display field (Windows).

@item
Update pollable mouse state with axes events as well as button events on
iPhone.

@end itemize

Filesystem:

@item
Made the filesystem entry functions work under Windows even if the name
passed to al_create_fs_entry has a trailing slash or backslash.
@end itemize

Config routines:

@itemize
@item
Add al_@{load,save@}_config_file_f.

@item
Reorder al_save_config_file* arguments to match al_save_bitmap and
al_save_sample.

@item
Optimise config routines to work well for thousands of keys/sections.

@end itemize

Image addon:

@itemize
@item
Added a GDI+ implementation of the image codecs, which will be used in
favour of libjpeg/libpng if Allegro is compiled with MSVC. Then
allegro_image will not require JPEG/PNG DLLs at runtime.

@item
Removed format specific image functions.

@item
Fixed bug in native png loader on iphone: was using the source color
space instead of the target color space which made it fail whenever they
differed (alpha-less paletted pictures).

@item
Add an autorelease pool around iphone native image loading to stop
memory leaks.

@end itemize

Font addons:

@itemize
@item
Sever the tie between allegro_font and allegro_image. The user needs to
initialise the image addon separately now.

@item
Rename al_load_ttf_font_entry to al_load_ttf_font_f.

@item
Fixed problem with glyph precision after applying transformations in the
ttf addon.

@end itemize

Primitives addon:

@itemize
@item
Added al_init_primitives addon function. This is now required.

@item
Removed ALLEGRO_PRIM_COLOR; ALLEGRO_COLOR can now be used where it was
required.

@item
v textures coordinates were off for OpenGL non-power-of-two textures.

@item
Free the vertex cache in al_destroy_display on X11.

@item
Added the dummy vertex shader support to D3D driver of the primitives
addon. Without this, custom vertices either resulted in warnings or
outright crashes on some systems.

@item
Bring D3D driver up to speed a little bit: transformations now work
properly with sub-bitmap targets; the half-pixel offset now properly
interacts with transformations; al_set_target_bitmap does not clear the
transformation; the proper transformation is set at display creation.

@item
Cull the primitives that are completely outside the clipping region.

@item
Scale the numbers of vertices for the curvy primitives with the scale of
the current transformation.

@end itemize

Audio addon:

@itemize

Audio codecs:

@itemize
@item
Add MOD/S3M/XM/IT file support, using the DUMB library.

@item
Revert to a monolithic allegro_acodec addon, i.e.@ remove separate
allegro_flac, allegro_vorbis addons. WAV file support is in
allegro_acodec.

@item
Implement DLL loading for FLAC/Vorbis/DUMB on Windows. allegro_acodec
will load the DLL at runtime to enable support for that format. If your
program does not require said format, you don't need to distribute the
DLL.

@item
Remove format-specific loader/saver audio codec functions.

@item
Make acodec loaders have consistent file closing behaviour.

@item
Optimised wave file loading.

@end itemize

Suntsov, Peter Wang. Other contributions from: Evert Glebbeek and Shawn
Hargreaves.

Graphics:

@itemize
@item
Implemented support for transformations for memory bitmaps.

@item
Transformations now work properly when the target bitmap is a sub-bitmap
in OpenGL (still broken in D3D). Also fixed OpenGL bitmap drawing in the
same scenario (it used to always revert to software drawing).

@item
Use the memory drawers when the source bitmap is the backbuffer with the
rotated/scaled bitmaps.

@item
Make al_put_pixel clip even if the bitmap is locked, which was the
reason why software primitives were not clipping.

@item
Added al_put_blended_pixel, the blended version of al_put_pixel.

@item
Sub bitmaps of sub bitmaps must be clipped to the first parent.

@item
Don't clear the transformation when setting the target bitmap in OpenGL.

@item
Implemented ALLEGRO_NOFRAME and ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW in WGL.

@item
Set the ALLEGRO_DISPLAY->refresh_rate variable for fullscreen modes
under D3D.

Don't call al_get_mouse_state if the mouse driver isn't installed
(Windows).

@item
Send events even when the mouse cursor leaves the window, while any
buttons are held down (Windows and Mac OS X; X11 already did this).

@item

@item
Made the D3D driver thread-safe. The whole addon should be thread-safe
now.

@item
The addon now officially supports 3D vertices, even though the software
component can't draw them yet.

@item
Changed the way the primitives addon handles the OpenGL state (fixes a
few bugs and makes life easier for raw-OpenGL people)

@end itemize

Image addon:

@itemize
@item
Optimised BMP, PCX, TGA loaders.

The main developers this time were: Trent Gamblin, Elias Pschernig,
Evert Glebbeek, Peter Wang. Other contributions from: Milan Mimica, Paul
Suntsov, Peter Hull.

Graphics:

@itemize
@item
Fixed broken drawing into memory bitmaps as access to the global
transformation required an active display. Now both transformation and
current blending mode are stored in the display but provisions are made
for them to also work if the current thread has no display.

@item
Fixed a bunch of clipping problems with OpenGL, especially with
sub-bitmaps.

@item
Fix bug in OpenGL FBO setup when the target bitmap is the sub-bitmap of
a bitmap with an FBO.

@item
Fixed crash in al_get_num_display_modes under OSX 10.5.

@item
Fixed some problems in _al_convert_to_display_bitmap that caused
problems in WGL FS display resize.

@item
Fixed al_set_current_display(NULL) on WGL.

@item

@item
Added ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW display flag (X11 and D3D for now).

@item
Allow changing ALLEGRO_FULLSCREEN_WINDOW with al_toggle_display_flag.

@item
Figured out how to switch display modes using Carbon on OS X 10.6.

@item
Stop the OpenGL driver on iPhone from changing the currently bound FBO
behind our back when locking a bitmap.

@item
Prevent screen flicker at app startup by simulating the splash screen
(iPhone).

@end itemize

Input:

@itemize
@item
Added ``pressure'' field to the mouse event struct and mouse state,
which can be used with pressure sensitive pointing devices,
i.e.@ tablets/stylus (currently OS X only).

@item
Report scroll ball ``w'' position in mouse event struct, on OS X.

@item
Removed OS X 10.1 specific code from mouse driver. We don't support OS X
10.1 any more.

@item
Fix building of Linux joystick driver on some systems.

@end itemize

Threads:

@itemize
@item
Fix a problem when al_join_thread() is called immediately after
al_start_thread(). The thread could be joined before the user's thread
function starts at all.

@item
Fix a possible deadlock with al_join_thread() on Windows (thanks to
Michał Cichoń for the report).

@item
Fix some error messages running threading examples on OS X.

Rename al_attach_sample_to_mixer to al_attach_sample_instance_to_mixer.

@item
Fix a premature free() when detaching samples and other audio objects.

@item
Fix mixers attaching to mixers.

@item
Pass correct number of samples to mixer postprocess callback.

@item
AudioQueue code was not compiled even though version requirements may
have been met (OS X).

@end itemize

Primitives addon:

@itemize
@item
Make high-level primitives functions thread safe. (note: the DirectX
driver is not yet thread safe)

@item
Fix a bug causing crashes on Windows 7 when using the primitives addon
and Direct3D (Invalid vertex declarations were being used).

@item
Fixed another issue with primitives drawing to memory bitmaps.

@item
Hopefully fix the bitmap clipping bugs, and make the D3D and
OGL/Software outputs to be near-identical again.

@end itemize

Image addon:

@itemize
@item
Added a ``native loader'' for MacOS X that uses the NSImage bitmap
loading functions. In addition to .png and .jpg, this allows us to read
a whole zoo of image formats (listed in allegro.log).

@item
Add native support for tif, jpg, gif, png, BMPf, ico, cur, xbm formats
to under IPhone.

@item
Fixed an over-zealous ASSERT() that disallowed passing NULL to
al_register_bitmap_loader() despite this being an allowed value.

@item
Avoid using a field which is deprecated in libpng 1.4.

@end itemize

Color addon:

@itemize
@item
Make al_color_name_to_rgb return a bool.
@end itemize

Native dialogs addon:

@itemize
@item
Fixed some erratic behaviour and crashes on OS X.
@end itemize

Build system:

@itemize
@item
Set VERSION and SOVERSION properties on targets to give Unix shared
libraries proper sonames. e.g.@ liballegro[_addon].so.4.9,
liballegro[_addon].4.9.dylib

@item
Static libraries are now named without version number suffixes to
minimise the differences with the shared libraries, which no longer have
the versions in their base names. e.g.@ liballegro[_addon]-static.a,
allegro[_addon]-static.lib

@item
Windows import libraries are also named without version suffixes, e.g.
liballegro[_addon].a, allegro[_addon].lib

@item
DLLs are named with a short version suffix, not the full version.
e.g.@ allegro-4.9.dll instead of allegro-4.9.18.dll

@item
Add support for Mac OS X frameworks (untested), which are enabled with
WANT_FRAMEWORKS and WANT_EMBED. There is one framework per addon.

@item
Search for static OGG/Vorbis libraries built with MSVC named
libogg_static.lib, etc.

@item
Updated iPhone XCode project.

@chapter Changes from 4.9.16 to 4.9.17 (February 2010)
@anchor{#changes-from-4.9.16-to-4.9.17-february-2010}
The main developers this time were: Trent Gamblin, Elias Pschernig,
Evert Glebbeek, Paul Suntsov, Peter Wang.

Core:

@itemize
@item
Removed END_OF_MAIN() everywhere.

For MSVC, we pass a linker option through a #pragma.

On Mac OS X, we rename main() and call it from a real main() function in
the allegro-main addon. The prototype for main() for C++ applications
should be “int main(int, char **)“, or the code will not compile on OS
X. For C, either of the normal ANSI forms is fine.

#define ALLEGRO_NO_MAGIC_MAIN disables the #pragma or name mangling, so
you can write a WinMain() or use al_run_main() yourself.

@end itemize

Graphics:

@itemize
@item
Fixed a bug in the OpenGL driver where al_draw_bitmap() wouldn't handle
blitting from the back buffer.

Fixed automatic detection of colour depth on OS X.

@item
Fixed al_get_num_display_modes() on Mac OS X 10.6.

@item
Removed al_get_num_display_formats, al_get_display_format_option,
al_set_new_display_format functions as they can't be implemented on
OSX/iPhone/GPX ports (and were awkward to use).

@item
Replaced al_toggle_window_frame function with a new function
al_toggle_display_flags.

@item
al_load_bitmap() and al_convert_mask_to_alpha() no longer reset the
current transformation.

@item
Add a minimize button to all non-resizable windows on Windows.

Peter Wang removed event masking abilities, that is, for the user to
prevent an event source from generating particular event types. This was
implemented using bitfields which limited the number of event types to
32. Although the limit could be raised event masking was probably not
very useful anyway. In all, the functions removed are:
al_event_source_mask, al_event_source_set_mask,
al_wait_for_specific_event. The al_wait_for_specific_event() API also
required event types to be bitfields.

the gui_bg_color.

@node Changes from 42 series to 490 July 2006
@chapter Changes from 4.2 series to 4.9.0 (July 2006)
@anchor{#changes-from-4.2-series-to-4.9.0-july-2006}
@emph{Note that 4.9.0 was called 4.3.0 when it was originally released.}

Basically we're just wrapping up what we have in version control up to
now. See the commit logs if you want details.

This release introduces a few new subsystems. We have an event system, a
new keyboard API, a new joystick API, a new timer API, and the start of
a new graphics API. All of these are subject to change, as is usual for
a WIP.

We are maintaining a certain level of source compatibility with the 4.2
API. If it's easy to maintain compatibility then we do it, otherwise
compatibility is dropped. Obscure features are more likely to be
dropped.

This release has had minimal testing on Linux/x86, Windows/x86 (MinGW)
and Windows/x86 (MSVC). It seems to work on some Linux/x86-64 machines
also. Other ports are broken or untested.

The new functions are as follows (in no particular order). No real
documentation exists at the moment but interesting header files are:
altime.h, display.h, draw.h, events.h, joystick.h, keyboard.h, timer.h.
