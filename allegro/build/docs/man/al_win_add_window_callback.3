.SH DESCRIPTION
The specified callback function will intercept the window\[cq]s message
before Allegro processes it.
If the callback function consumes the event, then it should return true.
In that case, Allegro will not do anything with the event.
.PP
Optionally, you may use \f[CR]result\f[R] to customize what Allegro will
return return in response to this event.
By default, Allegro returns \f[CR]TRUE\f[R].
.PP
The \f[CR]userdata\f[R] pointer can be used to supply additional context
to the callback function.
.PP
The callbacks are executed in the same order they were added.
.PP
Returns true if the callback was added.
