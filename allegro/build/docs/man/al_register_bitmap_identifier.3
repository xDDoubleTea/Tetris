extension and return true in that case, false otherwise.
The file handle must not be closed but there is no need to reset it to
the beginning.

The extension should include the leading dot (`.') character.
It will be matched case\-insensitively.

The \f[CR]identifier\f[R] argument may be NULL to unregister an entry.
