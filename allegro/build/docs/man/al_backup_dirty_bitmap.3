al_backup_dirty_bitmap \- Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS

.EX
#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro.h>\f[R]

void al_backup_dirty_bitmap(ALLEGRO_BITMAP *bitmap)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
On some platforms, notably Windows Direct3D and Android, textures may be
lost at any time for events such as display resize or switching out of
the app.
On those platforms, bitmaps created without the
ALLEGRO_NO_PRESERVE_TEXTURE flag automatically get backed up to system
memory every time al_flip_display is called.
.PP
This function gives you more control over when your bitmaps get backed
up.
By calling this function after modifying a bitmap, you can make sure the
bitmap is backed up right away instead of during the next flip.
