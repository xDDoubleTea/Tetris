#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro.h>\f[R]

void al_destroy_shader(ALLEGRO_SHADER *shader)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Destroy a shader.
Any bitmaps which currently use the shader will implicitly stop using
the shader.
In multi\-threaded programs, be careful that no such bitmaps are being
accessed by other threads at the time.
.PP
As a convenience, if the target bitmap of the calling thread is using
the shader then the shader is implicitly unused before being destroyed.
.PP
This function does nothing if the shader argument is NULL.
