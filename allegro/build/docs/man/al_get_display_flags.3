int al_get_display_flags(ALLEGRO_DISPLAY *display)

.SH DESCRIPTION
Gets the flags of the display.
.PP
In addition to the flags set for the display at creation time with
al_set_new_display_flags(3) it can also have the ALLEGRO_MINIMIZED flag
set, indicating that the window is currently minimized.
This flag is very platform\-dependent as even a minimized application
may still render a preview version so normally you should not care
whether it is minimized or not.
