.SH NAME
al_set_mouse_wheel_precision \- Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.EX
#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro.h>\f[R]

void al_set_mouse_wheel_precision(int precision)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Sets the precision of the mouse wheel (the z and w coordinates).
This precision manifests itself as a multiplier on the \f[CR]dz\f[R] and
\f[CR]dw\f[R] fields in mouse events.
It also affects the \f[CR]z\f[R] and \f[CR]w\f[R] fields of events and
ALLEGRO_MOUSE_STATE(3), but not in a simple way if you alter the
precision often, so it is suggested to reset those axes to 0 when you
change precision.
Setting this to a high value allows you to detect small changes in those
two axes for some high precision mice.
A flexible way of using this precision is to set it to a high value (120
is likely sufficient for most, if not all, mice) and use a floating
point \f[CR]dz\f[R] and \f[CR]dw\f[R] like so:
.IP
.EX
al_set_mouse_wheel_precision(120);

ALLEGRO_EVENT event;
al_wait_for_event(event_queue, &event);
\f[B]if\f[R] (event.type == ALLEGRO_EVENT_MOUSE_AXES) {
  double dz = (double)event.mouse.dz / al_get_mouse_wheel_precision();
  \f[I]/* Use dz in some way... */\f[R]
}
.EE
.PP
Precision is set to 1 by default.
It is impossible to set it to a lower precision than that.
