.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.EX
#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro_font.h>\f[R]

void al_draw_glyph(const ALLEGRO_FONT *f, ALLEGRO_COLOR color, float x, float y,
   int codepoint)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Draws the glyph that corresponds with \f[CR]codepoint\f[R] in the given
\f[CR]color\f[R] using the given \f[CR]font\f[R].
If \f[CR]font\f[R] does not have such a glyph, nothing will be drawn.
.PP
To draw a string as left to right horizontal text you will need to use
al_get_glyph_advance(3) to determine the position of each glyph.
For drawing strings in other directions, such as top to down, use
al_get_glyph_dimensions(3) to determine the size and position of each
glyph.
.PP
If you have to draw many glyphs at the same time, use
al_hold_bitmap_drawing(3) with true as the parameter, before drawing the
glyphs, and then call al_hold_bitmap_drawing(3) again with false as a
parameter when done drawing the glyphs to further enhance performance.
