.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.EX
#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro.h>\f[R]

void al_convert_memory_bitmaps(void)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
If you create a bitmap when there is no current display (for example
because you have not called al_create_display(3) in the current thread)
and are using the ALLEGRO_CONVERT_BITMAP bitmap flag (which is set by
default) then the bitmap will be created successfully, but as a memory
bitmap.
This function converts all such bitmaps to proper video bitmaps
belonging to the current display.
.PP
Note that video bitmaps get automatically converted back to memory
bitmaps when the last display is destroyed.
.PP
This operation will preserve all bitmap flags except
ALLEGRO_VIDEO_BITMAP and ALLEGRO_MEMORY_BITMAP.
