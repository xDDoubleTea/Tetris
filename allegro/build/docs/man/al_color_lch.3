#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro_color.h>\f[R]

ALLEGRO_COLOR al_color_lch(float l, float c, float h)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Return an ALLEGRO_COLOR(3) structure from CIE LCH values.
LCH colors are very similar to HSL, with the same meaning of L and H and
C corresponding to S. However LCH is more visually uniform.
Furthermore, this function expects the angle for H in radians and not in
degree.
.PP
The CIE LCH color space is a cylindrical representation of the L*a*b*
color space.
The L component is the same and C and H are computed like this:
.IP
.EX
C = sqrt(a * a + b * b)
H = atan2(b, a)
