#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro.h>\f[R]

bool al_set_shader_sampler(const char *name,
   ALLEGRO_BITMAP *bitmap, int unit)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Sets a texture sampler uniform and texture unit of the current target
bitmap\[cq]s shader.
The given bitmap must be a video bitmap.
.PP
Different samplers should use different units.
The bitmap passed to Allegro\[cq]s drawing functions uses the 0th unit,
so if you\[cq]re planning on using the \f[CR]al_tex\f[R] variable in
your pixel shader as well as another sampler, set the other sampler to
use a unit different from 0.
With the primitives addon, it is possible to free up the 0th unit by
passing \f[CR]NULL\f[R] as the texture argument to the relevant drawing
functions.
In this case, you may set a sampler to use the 0th unit and thus not use
\f[CR]al_tex\f[R] (the \f[CR]al_use_tex\f[R] variable will be set to
\f[CR]false\f[R]).
.PP
Returns true on success.
Otherwise returns false, e.g.\ if the uniform by that name does not
exist in the shader.
