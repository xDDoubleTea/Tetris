al_create_sample \- Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.EX
#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro_audio.h>\f[R]

ALLEGRO_SAMPLE *al_create_sample(void *buf, unsigned int samples,
   unsigned int freq, ALLEGRO_AUDIO_DEPTH depth,
   ALLEGRO_CHANNEL_CONF chan_conf, bool free_buf)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Create a sample data structure from the supplied buffer.
If \f[CR]free_buf\f[R] is true then the buffer will be freed with
al_free(3) when the sample data structure is destroyed.
For portability (especially Windows), the buffer should have been
allocated with al_malloc(3).
Otherwise you should free the sample data yourself.
.PP
A sample that is referred to by the \f[CR]samples\f[R] parameter refers
to a sequence channel intensities.
E.g.
if you\[cq]re making a stereo sample with the \f[CR]samples\f[R] set to
4, then the layout of the data in \f[CR]buf\f[R] will be:
.IP
.EX
LRLRLRLR
.EE
.PP
Where L and R are the intensities for the left and right channels
respectively.
A single sample, then, refers to the LR pair in this example.
.PP
To allocate a buffer of the correct size, you can use something like
this:
.IP
.EX
int sample_size = al_get_channel_count(chan_conf)
                  * al_get_audio_depth_size(depth);
int bytes = samples * sample_size;
void *buffer = al_malloc(bytes);
