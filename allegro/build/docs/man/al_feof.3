.IP

#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro.h>\f[R]

bool al_feof(ALLEGRO_FILE *f)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Returns true if the end\-of\-file indicator has been set on the file,
i.e.\ we have attempted to read \f[I]past\f[R] the end of the file.
.PP
This does \f[I]not\f[R] return true if we simply are at the end of the
file.
The following code correctly reads two bytes, even when the file
contains exactly two bytes:
.IP
.EX
int b1 = al_fgetc(f);
int b2 = al_fgetc(f);
\f[B]if\f[R] (al_feof(f)) {
   \f[I]/* At least one byte was unsuccessfully read. */\f[R]
   report_error();
}
