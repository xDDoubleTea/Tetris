.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.EX
#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro.h>\f[R]

#define al_init()    (al_install_system(ALLEGRO_VERSION_INT, atexit))
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Like al_install_system(3), but automatically passes in the version and
uses the atexit function visible in the current binary.

Note: It is typically wrong to call al_init anywhere except the final
game binary.
In particular, do not call it inside a shared library unless you know
what you\[cq]re doing.
In those cases, it is better to call al_install_system either with a
\f[CR]NULL\f[R] atexit_ptr, or with a pointer to atexit provided by the
user of this shared library.
