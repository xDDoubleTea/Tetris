al_draw_filled_polygon_with_holes \- Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.EX
#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro_primitives.h>\f[R]

void al_draw_filled_polygon_with_holes(const float *vertices,
   const int *vertex_counts, ALLEGRO_COLOR color)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Draws a filled simple polygon with zero or more other simple polygons
subtracted from it \- the holes.
The holes cannot touch or intersect with the outline of the filled
polygon.
.IP \[bu] 2
vertices \- Interleaved array of (x, y) vertex coordinates for each of
the polygons, including holes.
.IP \[bu] 2
vertex_counts \- Number of vertices for each polygon.
The number of vertices in the filled polygon is given by
vertex_counts[0] and must be at least three.
Subsequent elements indicate the number of vertices in each hole.
The array must be terminated with an element with value zero.
.IP \[bu] 2
color \- Color of the filled polygon
.PP
When the y\-axis is facing downwards (the usual) the filled polygon
coordinates must be ordered anti\-clockwise.
All hole vertices must use the opposite order (clockwise with y down).
All hole vertices must be inside the main polygon and no hole may
overlap the main polygon.

For example:

.EX
float vertices[] = {
      0,   0, \f[I]// filled polygon, upper left corner\f[R]
      0, 100, \f[I]// filled polygon, lower left corner\f[R]
    100, 100, \f[I]// filled polygon, lower right corner\f[R]
    100,   0, \f[I]// filled polygon, upper right corner\f[R]
     10,  10, \f[I]// hole, upper left\f[R]
     90,  10, \f[I]// hole, upper right\f[R]
     90,  90  \f[I]// hole, lower right\f[R]
};
int vertex_counts[] = {
   4, \f[I]// number of vertices for filled polygon\f[R]
   3, \f[I]// number of vertices for hole\f[R]
   0  \f[I]// terminator\f[R]
};
.EE
.PP
There are 7 vertices: four for an outer square from (0, 0) to (100, 100)
in anti\-clockwise order, and three more for an inner triangle in
clockwise order.
The outer main polygon uses vertices 0 to 3 (inclusive) and the hole
uses vertices 4 to 6 (inclusive).
