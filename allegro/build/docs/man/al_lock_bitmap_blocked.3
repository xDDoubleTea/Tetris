#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro.h>\f[R]

ALLEGRO_LOCKED_REGION *al_lock_bitmap_blocked(ALLEGRO_BITMAP *bitmap,
   int flags)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Like al_lock_bitmap(3), but allows locking bitmaps with a blocked pixel
format (i.e.\ a format for which al_get_pixel_block_width(3) or
al_get_pixel_block_height(3) do not return 1) in that format.
To that end, this function also does not allow format conversion.
For bitmap formats with a block size of 1, this function is identical to
calling
\f[CR]al_lock_bitmap(bmp, al_get_bitmap_format(bmp), flags)\f[R].
.RS
.PP
\f[I]Note:\f[R] Currently there are no drawing functions that work when
the bitmap is locked with a compressed format.
al_get_pixel(3) will also not work.
