al_reserve_samples \- Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.EX
#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro_audio.h>\f[R]

bool al_reserve_samples(int reserve_samples)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reserves a number of sample instances, attaching them to the default
mixer.
If no default mixer is set when this function is called, then it will
create one and attach it to the default voice.
If no default voice has been set, it, too, will be created.
.PP
If you call this function a second time with a smaller number of
samples, then the excess internal sample instances will be destroyed
causing some sounds to stop and some instances returned by
al_lock_sample_id(3) to be invalidated.
