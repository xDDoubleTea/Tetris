.EX
#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro.h>\f[R]

void al_uninstall_haptic(void)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Uninstalls the haptic device subsystem.
This is useful since on some platforms haptic effects are bound to the
active display.
.PP
If you need to close and reopen your active display for example, then
you should call al_uninstall_haptic(3) before closing the display, and
al_install_haptic(3) after opening it again.
.SH SINCE
5.1.8
.RS
.PP
\f[I][Unstable API]:\f[R] Perhaps could be simplified due to limited
support for all the exposed features across all of the platforms.
Awaiting feedback from users.
