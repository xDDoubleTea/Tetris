#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro_primitives.h>\f[R]

void al_calculate_spline(float* dest, int stride, float points[8],
   float thickness, int num_segments)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Calculates a Bézier spline given 4 control points.
If \f[CR]thickness <= 0\f[R], then \f[CR]num_segments\f[R] of points are
required in the destination, otherwise twice as many are needed.
The destination buffer should consist of regularly spaced (by distance
of stride bytes) doublets of floats, corresponding to x and y
coordinates of the vertices.
