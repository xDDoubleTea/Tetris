#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro_audio.h>\f[R]

void al_unlock_sample_id(ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID *spl_id)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Unlocks a ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_ID(3), allowing future calls to
al_play_sample(3) to reuse it if possible.
Note that after the id is unlocked, the ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCE(3) that
was previously returned by al_lock_sample_id(3) will possibly be playing
a different sound, so you should only use it after locking the id again.
