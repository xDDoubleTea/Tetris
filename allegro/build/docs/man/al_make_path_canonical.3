al_make_path_canonical \- Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.EX
#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro.h>\f[R]

bool al_make_path_canonical(ALLEGRO_PATH *path)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Removes any leading `..' directory components in absolute paths.
Removes all `.' directory components.
.PP
Note that this does \f[I]not\f[R] collapse \[lq]x/../y\[rq] sections
into \[lq]y\[rq].
This is by design.
If \[lq]/foo\[rq] on your system is a symlink to \[lq]/bar/baz\[rq],
then \[lq]/foo/../quux\[rq] is actually \[lq]/bar/quux\[rq], not
\[lq]/quux\[rq] as a naive removal of \[lq]..\[rq] components would give
you.
