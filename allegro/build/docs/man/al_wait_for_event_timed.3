.SH DESCRIPTION
Wait until the event queue specified is non\-empty.
If \f[CR]ret_event\f[R] is not NULL, the first event in the queue will
be copied into \f[CR]ret_event\f[R] and removed from the queue.
If \f[CR]ret_event\f[R] is NULL the first event is left at the head of
the queue.

\f[CR]secs\f[R] determines approximately how many seconds to wait.
If the call times out, false is returned.
Otherwise, if an event ocurred, true is returned.
.PP
For compatibility with all platforms, \f[CR]secs\f[R] must be
2,147,483.647 seconds or less.
