.SH SYNOPSIS

.EX
#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro.h>\f[R]

bool al_ustr_prev(const ALLEGRO_USTR *us, int *pos)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Find the byte offset of the previous code point in string, before
\f[CR]*pos\f[R].
\f[CR]*pos\f[R] does not have to be at the beginning of a code point.
Returns true on success, and the value pointed to by \f[CR]pos\f[R] will
be updated to the found offset.
Otherwise returns false if \f[CR]*pos\f[R] was already at the end of the
string, and \f[CR]*pos\f[R] is unmodified.
.PP
This function just looks for an appropriate byte; it doesn\[cq]t check
if found offset is the beginning of a valid code point.
If you are working with possibly invalid UTF\-8 strings then it could
skip over some invalid bytes.
