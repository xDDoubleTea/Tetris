#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro.h>\f[R]

const char *al_path_cstr(const ALLEGRO_PATH *path, char delim)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Convert a path to its string representation, i.e.\ optional drive,
followed by directory components separated by `delim', followed by an
optional filename.
.PP
To use the current native path separator, use ALLEGRO_NATIVE_PATH_SEP
for `delim'.
.PP
The returned pointer is valid only until the path is modified in any
way, or until the path is destroyed.
This returns a null\-terminated string.
If you need an ALLEGRO_USTR instead, use al_path_ustr(3).
